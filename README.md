This task is a featured time regreession problem.

The code comments, name of features, variables and name of functions are descriptive enough, but I explain more about it.
I use a regression model for predict target value. And like as any datascience project, missing values are handled.

I must state that I wanted to model it using a time regressor for repeated shows and regressor for new shows, but I can't do that becuase of lack of time.
