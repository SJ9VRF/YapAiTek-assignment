This task is a featured time regreession problem.

The code comments, name of features, variables and name of functions are descriptive enough, but I explain more about it.
I use a regression model for predict target value. And like as any datascience project, data preprocessing are done.

I must state that I wanted to model it using a time regressor for repeated shows and regressor for new shows, but I can't do that becuase of lack of time.

- the data is uploaded on google_drive

- the development data is selected like as time range of test data

- the final result is as follows:

MAE, R-Score
train:
(0.30186724917237595, 0.6395927056645858)
dev:
(0.35314016986727287, 0.4878192698923055)
